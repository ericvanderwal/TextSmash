Text Smash is an open source blazor (asp.net core) project running in .net 5. It is hosted on netlify.com and built using github actions.

## A Blazor OpenSource Text Manipulation Project

This client side blazor project is delivered via CDN and runs locally in the clients browser, thereby saving the cost of server processing power. The downside to client side rendering with blazor is the inital load times are significantly longer.

Text Smash is an ongoing project and is not production ready. You can find it at https://www.textsmash.com
